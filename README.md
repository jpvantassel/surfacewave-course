# Surface Wave Testing

> Joseph P. Vantassel, The University of Texas at Austin

## About this course

This course is a collection of my personal notes on surface wave testing. The
course is still in the development stage with no planned completion date.
Since modules are written on a purely ad hoc basis, I have attempted to write
them to be more or less self-contained in the hope they may be of some use prior
to the completion of the course.

When complete this course will include notes covering the three steps of
surface wave testing: acquisition, processing, and inversion. This includes in
particular the layout and design of 1D and 2D surface wave arrays, processing of
active-source (i.e., MASW) and passive-wavefield (i.e., MAM) data into
experimental dispersion data, and inversion of the experimental dispersion data
to produce a 1D velocity model.
